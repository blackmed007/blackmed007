# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Abdelhamid, a passionate software development student.

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## Current Projects

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on two exciting projects:

1. **Expedia Project**: I'm actively contributing to the Expedia project, where I'm developing a comprehensive travel booking platform. It's a simplified version of expedia.com using Python and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

2. **Company Payroll System**: Additionally, I'm involved in developing a payroll system using Python and OOP. This project aims to streamline and automate the payroll processes within a company.

## Project Completion

I'm diligently working towards completing both projects by July 10th. While I work on these projects, you can also check out my completed projects.

## Future Projects

Looking ahead, I have some exciting plans for future projects focusing on data structures and algorithms. I'll be leveraging both Java and Python to build efficient and optimized solutions.
